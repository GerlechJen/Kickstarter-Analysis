# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter data of over 4000 fundraising campaigns is available for analysis. (give background to the project)

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find out the outcome of different fundraising campaigns based on the goals set for the campaigns as well as the launch dates of the campaigns.


## Analysis and Challenges 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

These are some conclusions that can be drawn from analyzing the chart above:
1. The month of May had the highest number of successful outcomes with 111 successful campaigns.
2. The month of December had the least number of successful campaigns with just 37 successful campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The goals set for a campaign that not have an effect on the success or failure of the campaign.

From the chart above the goal set does not have a significant effect on the success or failure of the campaign. When the goal started at less than $1,000 the success rate kept on decreasing with increase in goal set up to $29,999. However, after that set goal when the goal kept increasing the success rate started going up for a while before decreasing to 0 at $45,000 to $49,999 and the finally increasing again to 13% at more than $50,000 goal. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. We could create a graph to study if the duration of a fundraising campaign has an influence on the outcome.
2. We could also create a graph to check whether backers count has an influence on the success or failure of a fundraising campaign.

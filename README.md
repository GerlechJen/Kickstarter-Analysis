# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Analysis was performed on Kickstarter data to discover trends in fundraising activities for different sectors in different countries.
The data had over 4000 records. 
After analyzing the data we realized certain factors influence the success of a fundraising campaign. 

From the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart below, campaigns started in the month of May had the highest success rate followed by June. 
December start months 
had the least successful rate.
January, June, July, and October had the highest as well similar number of failed campaigns launched.

From the Parent Category Outcomes Chart below, it can be seen that the theater is the most successful type of campaign.

Statistical analysis was further performed on plays in US. The results of the analysis showed that Failed Kickstarter fundraising campaigns had a higher average goal than successful Kickstarter campaigns. The average and median pledges for the failed campaigns 
were also much lower than that of the successful campaigns. This implies that aside from the high goals set, there could be other factors that could be
influencing people from pledging in the failed fundraising campaigns. 

To mirror successful campaigns it is recommended to set campaign goals around the average of the pledges.
For successful plays carried out in the US, the standard deviation of the goal and pledge were roughly twice the IQR while the standard deviation of the goal and pledge for the failed plays was almost three times the IQR. This implies that some of the failed kickstarters had really high goals.

For the future musicals project in Great Britain, the estimated budget of 4000 is too high. From the box and whisker analysis, campaign goals have averaged around this same figure but the average pledge is below 2000. So you should estimate this project to be produced for around 2000 instead.

For successful Theatre campaigns, the average goal was around 46600 while the average pledge was around 12100. Based on these findings I will recommend that the goal of your theater campaign be reduced to the average of similar campaign pledges and you should start the campaign in June.

A shortcoming of this analysis is we are unable to tell whether the duration of a campaign has any effect on its success or failure. From the overall analysis done, it cannot be concluded whether or not the length of a campaign has an effect on the outcome. There were campaigns that lasted for a short time yet were succcessful while longer campaigns were not successful and vice versa.

# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Analysis was performed on Kickstarter data to discover trends in fundraising activities for different sectors in different countries. The data had over 4000 records. 
After analyzing the data we realized certain factors influence the success of a fundraising campaign. 
From the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart, campaigns started in the month of May had the highest success rate followed by June. December start months 
had the least successful rate.
January, June, July, and October had the highest as well similar number of failed campaigns launched.
From the Parent Category Outcomes Chart below, 

The theater is the most successful type of campaign.

Statistical analysis was further performed on plays in US. The results of the analysis showed that Failed Kickstarter fundraising campaigns had a higher average goal than successful Kickstarter campaigns. The average and median pledges for the failed campaigns 
were also much lower than that of the successful campaigns. This implies that aside from the high goals set, there could be other factors that could be
influencing people from pledging in the failed fundraising campaigns. To mirror succsssful campaigns it is recommended to set campaign goals around the average of the pledges.
For successful palys carried out in the US, the standard deviation of the goal and pledge were roughly twice the inter quartile range while the standard deviation of the goal and pledge for the failed plays was almost three times the inter quartile range. This implies that some of tehfailed kickstarters had really high goals 
Does the length of a campaign have an influence?
For the future musicals project in Great Britain, the estimated budget of 4000 is too high. Campaign goals have averaged around this same figure. However, 
for actual amounts pledged, 4000 is utside the range. The average of pledges is below 2000. So you should get this project to be produced for around 2000 
instead.
Based on these findings I will recommend that the goal of your campaign be reduced to and you should start the campaign in June. 
Shortcomings of this analysis is we are unable to tell what other factors aside the launch date and goal that influences the success of the campaigns.
